      <h1>Terms</h1>

      <p>
        Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms" or "Terms and
        Conditions") carefully before using the www.getsnip.io website, the Snip
        Cloud service and the Snip desktop application (together, or
        individually, the "Service") operated by Snip ("Snip", "us", "we", or
        "our"). For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the
        user of the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your
        acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all
        visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have
        permission to access the Service. If you are accessing or using the
        Service on behalf of a business or entity, then your business or entity
        is legally and financially responsible for your access to and use of the
        Service as well as for the use of your account by others affiliated with
        your entity, including any employees, agents or contractors.
      </p>

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Definitions</strong>

        For purposes of these Terms: (i) “Content” means text, graphics, images,
        music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and
        information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or
        otherwise made available through the Service; and (ii) “User Content”
        means any Content that account holders (including you) provide to be
        made available through the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our Content Ownership</strong>

        We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in
        these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to
        use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, Snip and
        its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to
        the Service and Content (excluding User Content), including all
        associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the
        Service and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other
        laws of Switzerland and foreign countries. You agree not to remove,
        alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other
        proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service
        or Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Rights in User Content Granted by You</strong>

        By making any User Content available through the Service, you hereby
        grant to Snip a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free
        license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host, cache, store,
        reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish,
        distribute and modify (for formatting purposes only), your User Content
        solely in connection with operating and providing the Service and
        Content to you and, depending on the permission you grant, to other
        users. Subject to the foregoing license, as between Snip and you, you
        retain any and all of your rights to your User Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Your Responsibility for User Content</strong>

        You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and
        warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that
        are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under
        these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User
        Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made
        available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by Snip
        on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a
        third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or
        privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sharing User Content</strong>

        You may designate your User Content as “public” (such as posting User
        Content as a Blog Post) or “private”. You agree that User Content you
        designate as public will be accessible by and be available to other
        users of the Service to whom you grant access to such publicly
        designated User Content. Consequently, you understand and agree that
        such users will have the right to view, comment on and tag your publicly
        designated User Content. If you grant users additional permissions with
        respect to your User Content, you understand and agree that such users
        will, depending on the permissions you grant, have the right to use,
        publish, display, modify, or duplicate such User Content. You grant Snip
        all rights necessary to make any of your publicly designated User
        Content available to other users of the Service and to permit those
        users to engage in the activities described in this Section with respect
        to your publicly designated User Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Removal of User Content</strong>

        You can remove your User Content that you designate as private by
        specifically deleting it. However, some of your User Content may not be
        completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist
        on the Service. Additional details with respect to the removal and
        storage of User Content are set forth in Section 17 (Termination) below.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Rights in Content Granted by Snip</strong>

        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Snip grants to you a
        limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, with no right to
        sublicense, to download, view, copy, display and print the Content
        solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and solely
        for your personal and non-commercial purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Monitoring Content</strong>

        Although we’re not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Service
        or Content or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so
        for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure compliance with
        these Terms and to comply with applicable law or other legal
        requirements. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove or
        disable access to any Content, including User Content, at any time and
        without notice, including, but not limited to, if we, at our sole
        discretion, consider any Content to be objectionable or in violation of
        these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms
        or conduct that affects the Services. We may also consult and cooperate
        with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.

      <!-- TODO more specitic terms once collaboration features are here -->

      <!-- TODO more specitic terms once subscriptions are here -->

      <h2>Free Trial</h2>

      <p>
        Snip may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial
        for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial,
        you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by
        following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription
        section of these Terms. If you or Snip cancel your Free Trial, you
        acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your User Content or
        data associated with the Account that was assigned to your Free Trial.
        If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be
        converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you
        hereby authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method
        for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription. You may
        then however, cancel your Subscription in accordance with the
        Subscription section of these Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        At any time and without notice, Snip reserves the right to (a) modify
        the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer, (b) cancel any Free
        Trial offer, or (c) cancel any Free Trial subscription at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Fees and Fee Changes</h2>

      <p>
        Snip, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
        Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
        will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Snip will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
        Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
        Subscription before such change becomes effective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
        comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
        Subscription fee amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental
        assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales,
        use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively,
        “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with
        your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income.
        Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any
        government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>

      <p>
        Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable
        and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Snip on a
        case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Snip.
